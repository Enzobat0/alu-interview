# Min Operations to Achieve n Characters
This exercise deals with a text editor that can execute only two operations: Copy All and Paste. The initial state of the text file contains a single character 'H'. The goal is to write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n 'H' characters in the file.

# Problem Description
Given a number n, the task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly n 'H' characters in the file using the provided operations.

# Example
Consider the following example:

```python
n = 9```

The sequence of operations to achieve 9 'H' characters might be:

```javascript
Copy code
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
The minimum number of operations in this case is 6.

#Function Prototype
```python
def minOperations(n)
Returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations. If it is impossible to achieve n 'H' characters, the function should return 0.

#Approach
The solution involves utilizing dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum number of operations for each number from 1 to n. The key idea is to iteratively consider all possible factors of each number and update the minimum operations accordingly.

#Base Case
If n is 0 or 1, no operations are needed, and the function returns 0.

#Dynamic Programming
Initialize an array to store the minimum operations required for each number.
Set the minimum operations for 1 as 0.
Iterate through numbers from 2 to n.
For each number i, iterate through all possible factors j.
Update the minimum operations for i based on copying from j and pasting i//j times or copying from i//j and pasting j times.
The result is the minimum number of operations to reach n characters.
Result
Return the minimum number of operations to achieve n characters, unless it's impossible (in which case, return 0).

Testing
Test the function with different values of n to ensure it returns the expected results. Examples can include both achievable and unachievable scenarios.
